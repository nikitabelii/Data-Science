This code is a Python script that fetches a Google Slides presentation, converts it to a PDF document, and then extracts the slides from the PDF, displaying each slide as an image using the `matplotlib` library. Let's break down the code step by step:

1. **Installation Commands:**
   apt-get install poppler-utils
   pip install pdf2image
    
   - These commands install necessary dependencies. `poppler-utils` is required for working with PDF files, and `pdf2image` is a Python library for converting PDFs to images.

2. **Importing Libraries:**
   from pdf2image import convert_from_path
   import requests
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   import numpy as np
   from skimage.io import imread
   from skimage.transform import resize
   
  - Here, several Python libraries are imported. `pdf2image` is used to convert PDF pages to images, `requests` is used for making HTTP requests, `matplotlib` for plotting images, `numpy` for numerical operations, and `skimage` for image processing.

3. **Function Definitions:**
   - `plot(x)`: This function takes an image `x`, displays it using `matplotlib`, and hides the axis. It then sets the figure size to 5x5 inches and shows the plot.
   - `get_google_slide(url)`: This function takes a Google Slides URL, extracts the necessary components to create a URL for exporting the presentation as a PDF, and returns the export URL.
   - `get_slides(url)`: This function takes a Google Slides URL, fetches the presentation as a PDF using `requests`, saves it as 'file.pdf', and then converts the PDF into a list of images using `convert_from_path`.

4. **Google Slides URL:**
   Data_Deck = "https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/12NWxIiiMua9mB6Lsj09JiyxC1FHvcO2Mrhf4jkOQeYo/edit#slide=id.g1e604f0493b_0_26"

  - This is the URL of the Google Slides presentation you want to fetch.

5. **Fetching and Displaying Slides:**
   image_list = get_slides(Data_Deck)
   n = len(image_list)
   for i in range(n):
       plot(image_list[i])
       print(np.array(image_list[i]).shape)
    
   - It calls `get_slides` to fetch the slides from the Google Slides URL.
   - Then, it iterates through each slide in `image_list`, displaying it using the `plot` function and printing its shape.

In summary, this script allows you to download and view the slides of a Google Slides presentation as images. It first converts the presentation to a PDF, then extracts and displays each slide as an image using `matplotlib`.
